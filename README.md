# Scanner-And-Parser
Project is developed by Eric Phan, Khoa Ho, Khanh Nguyen

1.	Module_3 – 1st Deliverable
Develop a complete scanner for the subset of the SCL language (is an experimental system programming language that can be used as: http://ksuweb.kennesaw.edu/~jgarrido/sysplm/). The scanner implementation must include an array of the keywords used in the subset of SCL or other selected programming Language, an array (or list) of the identifiers, and other tokens (such as operators, constants, and/or special characters.)

Define the grammar of a subset of SCL. You must submit a short report describing the work performed. You must also include the grammar of the subset of SCL, source code files of the scanner program, the input and output files. The report must show the execution of this scanner program by using appropriate input files, the program must show a list of the tokens scanned.  

2.	Module_5 – 2nd Deliverable
	Develop a complete parser for the subset of the SCL language. This parser program must execute with the scanner. The report must show the execution of this parser program by using one or more relevant input files, the program must show the corresponding statements recognized. The report must describe the work performed. Include the parser source program, input and output files.

3. Module_7 – 3rd Deliverable
Develop a complete interpreter or a translator to intermediate code and an abstract machine. that includes the scanner, parser, and executer. The report must show the execution of this interpreter program by using one or more input files, the program must show the results of executing every statement recognized by the parser. Write a report describing the work performed. Include the source code of the program, input and output files.
